# Activities

These techical activities provide a range of examples which seek to
demonstrate how to develop with seL4. For each activity our development
process is discussed which intends to shed light on the our experience with
writing programs in seL4. This aims to show the lessons we learnt along the
way and act as inspiration for others wishing to embark on writing their own
systems and programs with seL4.

* **[Microkit Memory Probe](../activity/microkit_memory_probe/main.md)** - Simple Microkit program illustrating memory access.
* **[Device Drivers](../activity/device_drivers/main.md)** - Guidance on adding device drivers to seL4.
