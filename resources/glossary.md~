| ---- | ---------- |
| [AArch32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family#AArch32) | Execution state of [ARMv8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family#64/32-bit_architecture) architecture using 32-bit wide general-purpose registers. |
| [AArch64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64) | Execution state of [ARMv8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family#64/32-bit_architecture) architecture using 64-bit wide general-purpose registers. |
| [Avnet](https://www.avnet.com) | The manufacturer of the MaaXBoard SBC. |
| [Bootloader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootloader) | The tool responsible for booting a computer. Responsible for initialisation of software following by loading and execution of software. |
| [CAmkES](https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/camkes/) | Component Architecture for microkernel-based Embedded Systems. An abstraction layer on top of seL4 providing a software development and runtime framework for quickly and reliably building microkernel-based multiserver (operating) systems. |
| [Device Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devicetree) | A [standardised data structure](https://www.devicetree.org/specifications/) with nodes that describe the hardware components of a computer system. Associated with device trees are DTS files (Device Tree Source - a textual representation of a device tree), DTB files (Device Tree Blob - a binary representation of a device tree), and DTC (Device Tree Compiler - a tool used to convert between device tree formats, e.g. DTS to DTB). |
| [DMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access) | Direct Memory Access. A feature that allows certain hardware subsystems to access main system memory independently of the central processing unit (CPU), typically used by devices that need to transfer bulk data (e.g. USB). |
| [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) | A tool that allows packaging of an application and its dependencies within a container, with fewer overheads than a virtual machine. It is used in this developer kit to provide a standardised build environment. |
| [GPIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output#Board-level_GPIOs) | General-Purpose Input/Output. A digital signal pin on an integrated circuit or electronic circuit board which may be used as an input or output, or both, and is controllable by software. |
| [High-side](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/whitepaper/security-architecture-anti-patterns) | In a security context, 'more trusted' or 'high-side' refers to a system in which there is more confidence of its integrity. |
| [Low-side](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/whitepaper/security-architecture-anti-patterns) | In a security context, 'less trusted' or 'low-side' refers to a system in which there is less confidence of its integrity. |
| [MaaXBoard](https://www.avnet.com/wps/portal/us/products/avnet-boards/avnet-board-families/maaxboard/maaxboard) | An [NXP i.MX 8M SoC](https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-processors/i-mx-applications-processors/i-mx-8-applications-processors/i-mx-8m-family-armcortex-a53-cortex-m4-audio-voice-video:i.MX8M) based SBC. Selected as the target platform for this developer kit. |
| [SBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer) | Single Board Computer. A complete computer on a single circuit board. The Avnet MaaXBoard is an example of a SBC. |
| [seL4Test](https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/sel4test/) | Test suite for seL4 developed and maintained by the seL4 Foundation. |
| [SoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip) | System on chip. A chip that integrates all or most components of a computer. The SoC on the MaaXBoard is the [NXP i.MX 8M](https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-processors/i-mx-applications-processors/i-mx-8-applications-processors/i-mx-8m-family-armcortex-a53-cortex-m4-audio-voice-video:i.MX8M). |
| [TFTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol) | Trivial File Transfer Protocol. A simple file transfer protocol commonly used in the early stages of bootloading from a local area network. |
| [U-Boot](https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot) | Das U-Boot (known as "the Universal Boot Loader" and often shortened to U-Boot) is an open-source bootloader commonly used in embedded devices. |
| [UART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter) | Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter. A simple serial communication device commonly used by SBCs. |
