# Avnet MaaxBoard

The Avnet MaaXBoard SBC (Single Board Computer) has been selected as the
target platform for developing and investiagating this seL4 Developer Kit. 

The following high level features of the Avnet MaaXBoard SBC make it
particually suitable for use with the seL4 Developer Kit:

- __Inexpensive__: The Avnet MaaXBoard SBC is relitively inexpensive, minimising
  the cost of getting started with the seL4 Developer Kit.

- __Available__: While not a routine product, it is straight forward to identify
  suppliers with multiple instances of the Avnet MaaXBoard in stock.

- __Devices__: The Avnet MaaXBoard incorporates a wide collection of input and
  output devices, simplifying its practical usage, and permitting some
flexibility in the activities that may be explored with the seL4 Developer
Kit. 

- __Architecture__: The Avnet MaaXBoard supports an ARM architecture (AArch32
  and AArch64). In general, the ARM architecture, in contrast to the x86
architecture, is much simpler, which is particularly suitable for security
focused applications. More so, because of this intrinsic suitability, the seL4
Microkernel and its associated components, tend to offer greater support and
capabilities for the ARM architecture.

- __Open__: The detailed technical aspects of the Avnet MaaXBoard, its
  resident devices, and the ARM architecture, are well documented and freely
publicly available.

## Specifications

The Avnet MaaXBoard SBC is the first of a family of SBCs. 

For clarity, we
provide specific details on the Avnet MaaXBoard SBC as used in the 


seL4 Developer Kit:


The Avnet MaaxBoard uses the i.MX 8M Quad processor developed by NXP. The
application processor reference manual is a useful document for developing
atop this processor. This link for this manual is
[here](https://www.nxp.com/webapp/sps/download/preDownload.jsp?render=true).

I find this frustratingly intangible. The Avnet MaaXBoard (Website) describes
its Processor as: "NXP i.MX 8M Processor with Quad Arm Cortex-A53 and single
Cortex-M4F". Wikipedia has https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I.MX, which explores
the family of these. There is a table for "i.MX 8M", with "i.MX 8M Quad" and
"i.MX 8M QuadLite" having four (Quad) Cortex-A53 and one Cortex-M4F. The
former (only) has "4Kp60, H.265 and VP9", and our MaaXBoard reports "Supports
up to 4k resolution", so it's likely this: "i.MX 8M Quad"

We can search a bit (for "i.MX 8 QuadMax Applications Processor Reference
Manual"), and find this exchange:

If we dig a little bit more, we may find also:

But, alas, this content is gated behind an account creation process. This
sends a code to your email. You need to enter the code within 10 minutes. This
proved problematic for a while.

We do find this, but unsure if is the latest:

  target platform ().



The Avnet MaaxBoard is a powerful single-board computer (SBC) designed to
cater to a embedded computing applications. Built around the NXP i.MX 8M Quad
processor, the MaaxBoard offers robust performance with its quad-core ARM
Cortex-A53 CPU and ARM Cortex-M4 co-processor, making it suitable for
multimedia, IoT, and industrial automation projects. It features a rich set of
I/O options, including multiple USB ports, Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI output, and
support for various display and camera interfaces, providing flexibility for
diverse development needs. The board is also equipped with 2GB of LPDDR4
memory and 16GB of eMMC storage, ensuring ample resources for running complex
applications. With its compatibility with popular Linux distributions and
support from a vibrant community, the Avnet MaaxBoard stands out as a
versatile and accessible platform for developers looking to prototype and
deploy innovative embedded solutions.
