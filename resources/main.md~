# Resources

This section presents a high level overview of the fundamental resources
associated with the seL4 Developer Kit. The majority of this section is
deliberately framed in terms of references to external content. The intention
is that developers will refer to, and return to, this section to find further
avenues of information to help with their efforts.

The section is structured as follows:
- [seL4 Microkernel](../resources/sel4_microkernel.md): Provide an overview of the
  seL4 Microkernel, focusing on its capabilities and infrastructure as relates
to the seL4 Developer Kit.
- [Avent MaaXBoard](../resources/avent_maaxboard.md): Describe the rationale
  behind the selection of our chosen SBC, the Avent MaaXBoard. Further,
summarise and reference entry points into its available resources.
- [Glossary](../resources/glossary.md): A consolidated glossary of key terms
  for subsequent reference.
