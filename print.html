<p>The <a href="https://sel4.systems">seL4 © Microkernel</a> is a technology of
increasing interest. It delivers specific capabilities and assurances, which
make it particularly suitable for applications that demand a trusted execution
environment and strong separation of concerns.</p>
<p>The seL4 Microkernel is engineered to deliver both high-assurance and
high-performance (<a href="https://sel4.systems/About/seL4-whitepaper.pdf">The seL4 Microkernel: An
Introduction</a>). High-assurance
is achieved through comprehensive formal verification. High-performance is
achieved through deliberate design and profiling, potentially accepting
greater complexity in the formal verification where this achieves higher
performance.</p>
<p>The development of the seL4 Microkernel is overseen by the <a href="https://sel4.systems/Foundation/">seL4
Foundation</a>, operating as project under The
<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a>. The entirety of the seL4
Microkernel, and its associated components, are made available as Open Source,
on Git Hub (<a href="https://github.com/seL4">seL4 Microkernel and associated
components</a>).</p>
<p>In common with all Microkernels, the seL4 Microkernel provides a minimum set
of essential features as needed to frame a viable OS (Operating System). There
is an expectation that further components will be introduced atop this OS, in
developing useful applications (such as drivers, libraries, and services).</p>
<p>As a consequence, developing on top of the seL4 microkernel is currently
complex and time-consuming, and the expertise is limited to a small number of
individuals and organisations. Thus, this seL4 Developer Kit is created to
reduce the barrier to entry for developing on top of seL4 Microkernel. The
overall intention is to encourage and support more organisations in adopting
seL4 in their projects and products.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="audience"><a class="header" href="#audience">Audience</a></h2>
<p>The intended audience is an application developer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experienced in programming within a Linux, macOS, or Windows environment.</li>
<li>Already familiar with seL4 concepts and benefits.</li>
<li>Looking for practical guidance in getting started with seL4.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="complementary-approach"><a class="header" href="#complementary-approach">Complementary Approach</a></h3>
<p>This seL4 Developer Kit does not intend to cover or replace any of the
extensive material as maintained by the seL4 Foundation (<a href="https://sel4.systems">seL4
Microkernel</a>) and associated organisations.</p>
<p>Instead, the purpose is to complement this existing material with practical
guidance about getting started with seL4. Throughout the seL4 Developer Kit,
reference is made to externally maintained material where appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-sel4-details"><a class="header" href="#focus-on-sel4-details">Focus on seL4 Details</a></h3>
<p>Whilst the seL4 Developer Kit aims to cover all the important configuration
steps, it does assume a reasonable level of developer knowledge. In general,
priority and prominence is given to seL4 specific details, while more routine
aspects are explained at a higher level or through external reference (such as
installing software or interacting with configuration management).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The seL4 Developer Kit intends to support developers in gaining familiarity
with seL4 Microkernel, and ultimately to encourage more use of seL4 within
projects and products. It does this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Selecting a readily available low-cost SBC (Single Board Computer) as the
target platform ((The <a href="introduction/%22../avent_maaxboard/main.html">Avnet MaaXBoard</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying the minimum needed to create a viable development platform, and
detailing specific hardware and software requirements to achieve this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supplying preconfigured build environments, plus associated examples, with
all the content required to generate seL4 executable programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrating how an seL4 executable program can be loaded and executed on
the chosen target platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documenting the specific steps needed, along with more general guidance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the fundamentals of building and executing an seL4 program are
established, the seL4 Developer Kit seeks to explain and encourage further
development through the presentation of a diverse series of Activities
(<a href="introduction/%22../activities/activities.html">Activities</a>).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="structure"><a class="header" href="#structure">Structure</a></h2>
<p>The seL4 Developer Kit is structured into the following sections to provide a
step-by-step guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong>: Introduce the potential benefits that the seL4 Microkernel
offers, acknowledge its steep learning curve, and position the seL4
Developer Kit as a means to help facilitate and encourage wider adoption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>seL4 Microkernel</strong>: A consolidated overview of the fundamental aspects of
the seL4 Microkernel, highlighting relevant material available from other
sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avent MaaXBoard</strong>: Explain the selection of our chosen SBC (Single Board
Computer), providing a consolidated overview of its core features,
highlighting relevant material available from other sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Development Platform</strong>: Identify and explain the minimum hardware and
software requirements needed to assemble a viable development platform for
using the seL4 Developer Kit. It is expected that, to meet these requirements,
some equipment will need to be purchased (for example, an Avent MaaXBoard).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Install and Configure</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Install and Configure</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Development Environment Setup</strong>: Guides the user through setup of all development environments such as unboxing and setup of the Avnet MaaXBoard as well as installation and configuration of all required tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>First Boot</strong>: Provides an introduction and overview of the bootloader, guidance on how to prepare an SD card with the bootloader, through to the first power-up of the Avnet MaaXBoard and interaction with the bootloader running on the board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>seL4 Application Development</strong>: Guides the user through the compilation of an seL4 binary followed by execution of the binary on the Avnet MaaXBoard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Device Driver Development</strong>: Presents a comprehensive and extensible device driver library, based upon the driver model used by U-Boot. It includes practical guidance on extending the library for other drivers and for other platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Case Study Application</strong>: Works through a simple application that uses the driver library and demonstrates different seL4 connection mechanisms between its protection domains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Appendices</strong>: Whilst the main sections of this document seek to simplify processes, e.g. through the use of pre-built assets and environments, it is accepted that this may result in a lack of flexibility. The appendices provide deeper technical details to enable greater flexibility. For example, where a pre-built asset or environment has been used, the appendices detail how they were built and provide guidance of how their configuration could be changed.</p>

The <a href="https://sel4.systems">seL4 Microkernel</a> is a technology of increasing
interest and has potential to deliver significant benefit across a range of
applications that require strong domain separation and software-enforced
trusted execution environments.</p>
<p>seL4 is formally verified software and therefore offers significant benefits
over other software-based implementations in terms of the assurance and trust
that can be gained. Given it is open source COTS technology, the potential for
reduced cost for high assurance products and reduced time to market are
significant.</p>
<p>Developing on top of the seL4 microkernel is currently complex and
time-consuming, and the expertise is limited to a small number of individuals
and organisations. This developer kit is targeted at reducing the barrier to
entry for using (i.e. developing on top of) the seL4 technology and increasing
the number of organisations that can cost-effectively adopt seL4 in their
products.</p>

<p>Microkit imposes a dependeny on the seL4 Kernel not satisfied in its main
branch. The following branch must be used: "microkit". The dependeny, and its
adoption onto main, is explored in detail here
"https://github.com/seL4/microkit/issues/52", and is (from our perspective)
all in-hand with the seL4 Foundation.</p>
<p>Pre-Build: Like any other kernel, seL4 can be compiled with different
features. See "config.cmake" in the seL4 code base.</p>
<p>Post-Build: The seL4 kernel, may receive at start up, a (dts) Device Tree
File, pre-compiled as a Device Tree Blob (or binary), to select and configure
and customise its behaviour.</p>

<p>While not brutally obvious, Microkit is the de-facto simple operating system
framework for doing anything much with the seL4 kernel. It totally replaces
CAmkES, though this is an ongoing transition, and many references to CAmkES
remain.</p>
<p>The Microkit build "build_sdk.py" takes control of the seL4 kernel
configuration and build, in particular it provides a set of board and
configuration arguments, to produce a set of board and configuration specific
microkit artefacts.</p>
<h1 id="virtualisation"><a class="header" href="#virtualisation">Virtualisation</a></h1>
<p>Trustworthy Systems is a contributor to the seL4 Foundation. The Trustworthy
Systems Virtualisation offering is likely the most maintained sel4
Virtualisation solution, with the additional benefit of tight Microkit
integration.</p>

<p>The route toward Virtualisation seems to have triggered the creation of quite
a few areas and repositories. In particular, pay close attention to the set of
Pull Requests, and also branches, all of which may contain code and
documentation notes and snippets of value. The following are likely old and
superseded, but it's handy to maintain the corpus, to identify what has been
located:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://sel4.systems">seL4 Microkernel</a> is a technology of increasing
interest and has potential to deliver significant benefit across a range of
applications that require strong domain separation and software-enforced
trusted execution environments.</p>
<p>seL4 is formally verified software and therefore offers significant benefits
over other software-based implementations in terms of the assurance and trust
that can be gained. Given it is open source COTS technology, the potential for
reduced cost for high assurance products and reduced time to market are
significant.</p>
<p>Developing on top of the seL4 microkernel is currently complex and
time-consuming, and the expertise is limited to a small number of individuals
and organisations. This developer kit is targeted at reducing the barrier to
entry for using (i.e. developing on top of) the seL4 technology and increasing
the number of organisations that can cost-effectively adopt seL4 in their
