# Audience

The intended audience is an application developer:
- Experienced in programming within a Linux, macOS, or Windows environment.
- Already familiar with seL4 concepts and benefits.
- Looking for practical guidance in getting started with seL4.

## Complementary Approach

This seL4 Developer Kit does not intend to cover or replace any of the
extensive material as maintained by the [seL4
Foundation](https://sel4.systems) and associated organisations.

Instead, the purpose is to complement this existing material with practical
guidance about getting started with seL4. Throughout the seL4 Developer Kit,
reference is made to externally maintained material where appropriate.

## Focus on seL4 Details

Whilst the seL4 Developer Kit aims to cover all the important configuration
steps, it does assume a reasonable level of developer knowledge. In general,
priority and prominence is given to seL4 specific details, while more routine
aspects are explained at a higher level or through external reference (such as
installing software or interacting with configuration management).
