## Overview

The seL4 Developer Kit supports developers in gaining familiarity with seL4
Microkernel, and ultimately to encourage more use of seL4 within projects and
products. It does this by:

- Selecting a readily available low-cost SBC (Single Board Computer) as the
  target platform (The [Avnet MaaXBoard]("../avent_maaxboard/main.md")).

- Identifying the minimum needed to create a viable development platform, and
  detailing specific hardware and software requirements to achieve this.

- Supplying preconfigured build environments, plus associated examples, with
  all the content required to generate seL4 executable programs.

- Demonstrating how an seL4 executable program can be loaded and executed on
  the chosen target platform.

- Documenting the specific steps needed, along with more general guidance.

Once the fundamentals of building and executing an seL4 program are
established, the seL4 Developer Kit seeks to explain and encourage further
development through the presentation of a diverse series of technical
[Activities]("../activities/activities.md").
