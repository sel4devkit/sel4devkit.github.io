# Structure

The seL4 Developer Kit is structured into the following sections to provide a
step-by-step guide:

- __Introduction__: Introduce the potential benefits that the seL4 Microkernel
  offers, acknowledge its steep learning curve, and position the seL4
Developer Kit as a means to help facilitate and encourage wider adoption.

- __Resources__: Provides an overview of the fundamental aspects of both the
  seL4 Microkernel and our chosen SBC (Single Board Computer), the the Avent
MaaXBoard, highlighting relevant supporting material from other sources. Also
presents a consolidated glossary of key terms for easy reference.

- __Development Platform__: Identify and explain the minimum hardware and
  software requirements needed to assemble a viable development platform for
using the seL4 Developer Kit. It is expected that, to meet these requirements,
some equipment will need to be purchased (for example, an Avent MaaXBoard).

- __Install and Configure__: Provides guidance, and explores options, in
  installing and configuring the development platform. Once complete, the
development platform will be ready for building sel4 programs, loading such
programs onto the target, and executing these programs on the target, with
terminal (text) input and output available.

- __First Boot__: Utilising a previously prepared development platform, walk
  through the steps in powering up the target (Avnet MaaXBoard), interacting
with the bootloader, and building and executing a small number of example
programs. On completion of this step, the development platform is prepared and
proven to operate.

- __Activities__: With the development platform established, a series of
  distinct technical activities are undertaken. Each Activity describes both
its approach, and the eventual outcome, seeking to illustrate how sel4
development may be practically progressed.
