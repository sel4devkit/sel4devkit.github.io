# CAmkES Case Study Application

This section works through an example to show some of our device drivers being used within a larger application. It is nominally labelled as a 'security domain' demonstrator (named `security_demo`) but this is mainly in the context of being a keyboard-based encryption device that was inspired by an Enigma machine! It is intentionally simple and its main purpose is to show data separation and to provide worked examples of inter-component communications using different seL4 mechanisms.

Extra functionality within the demonstration application is deliberately kept to a minimum to leave the source code less cluttered, so that the developer can readily see the 'more interesting' seL4 inter-component and device interactions without too much extra, feature-supporting code. In line with the rest of the developer kit, the demonstration application is intended to be more of a springboard for a developer kit user than a polished product for an end user.
