# Microkit Memory Probe

## Introduction

For this task the aim was to create an HDMI display driver. For inspiration we looked at U-Boot’s imx8m display driver because it is BSD licensed and minimally featured which was useful to use as an initial foundation to build upon. We opted to copy the code into our repository rather than have a fork like we did with the xHCI driver. This is because we used a minimal amount of U-Boot's code and it was easier to manage compared to keeping a fork of a large repository up to date.

The repository for this project is located [here](https://github.com/sel4devkit/sel4devkit-maaxboard-microkit-hdmi-driver).

The first goal was to understand U-Boot’s display driver and to set up our memory regions for the frame buffer and the physical devices required by the driver. After building and running the U-Boot example, we looked through the source code and found relevant sections in IMX8M technical specification to get a better understanding of how to write the display driver. We currently rely on the firmware provided by U-Boot which needs to be configured when setting up the development environment.

Through reading the technical specification we learnt that the two main components of the Maaxboard needed for the driver are the DCSS (Display Controller Subsystem) and the HDMI TX Controller. With this information we were able to understand the purpose of the memory register read and write operations and which register bits needed to be set for specific functionality. We decided to use one protection domain for the simplicity of having one area to handle all operations.
