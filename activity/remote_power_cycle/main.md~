# Remote Power Cycle

It is conventional for seL4 Microkernel to be deployed on embedded devices,
such as the Avent MaaXBoard. And it is conventional for applications installed
onto embedded devices to be designed to start, and never terminate. Thus, in a
development environment, it is very convenient to be able to routinely power
cycle the embedded device, to gain access to the bootloader, and adjust the
application.

The Avent MaaXBoard is powered from a standard USB Type C connection. Thus,
where the Avent MaaXBoard is physically present, the power switch to its USB-C
connection may be flipped off, and back on again, to trivially achieve a power
cycle.

However, where the Avent MaaXBoard is in a remote location, it is more awkward
to achieve a power cycle. One solution is to utilise a USB Hub with PPPS
(Per-Port Power Switching), as described below.
