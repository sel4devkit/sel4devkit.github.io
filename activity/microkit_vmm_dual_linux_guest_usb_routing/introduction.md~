# Background

The [seL4 Microkernel](https://sel4.systems) is a technology of increasing
interest and has potential to deliver significant benefit across a range of
applications that require strong domain separation and software-enforced
trusted execution environments.

seL4 is formally verified software and therefore offers significant benefits
over other software-based implementations in terms of the assurance and trust
that can be gained. Given it is open source COTS technology, the potential for
reduced cost for high assurance products and reduced time to market are
significant.

Developing on top of the seL4 microkernel is currently complex and
time-consuming, and the expertise is limited to a small number of individuals
and organisations. This developer kit is targeted at reducing the barrier to
entry for using (i.e. developing on top of) the seL4 technology and increasing
the number of organisations that can cost-effectively adopt seL4 in their
products.
